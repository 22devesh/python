# Question For a = 60 , b = 13 compare the numbers using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT.

a=60 # decimal value is 111100
b=13 #decimal value is 1101

# & = 001100
# | = OR = 111101
# ^ = XOR = 110001
# - = NOT , "a"= 000011,"b"= 0010


# QUESTION 01.  Which of the following statements assigns the value 25 to the variable x in Python:
# (a)x ← 25
# (b)x = 25
# (c) x := 25
# (d) int x = 25
# (e) x << 25

# ans is (b)

 
# 02. In Python, a variable may be assigned a value of one type, and then later assigned a value of a different type:
# False
# True

#ans is true because it can be convereted in another type also

# 03. Which one of the following is the correct way of declaring and initializing a variable, x with the value 7?
# int x
# x=7
# int x=7
# x=7
# declare x=7
 
 #ans is - x= 7

 
 
# 04. What will be the output of statement 2**2**2**2
# 16
# 256
# 32768
# 65536

print(2**2**2**2) # = 65536


# 05. Which of the following statement is False?
# Variable names can be arbitrarily long.
# They can contain both letters and numbers.
# Variable name can begin with underscore.
# Variable name can begin with number.

# ans is - variable name can begin with number


# 06. What is the output of the following code: print 9//2
# 4
# 4.5
# 4.0
# Error
print(9//2) # = 4

# 07. Which of the following is not a valid variable name in Python?
# _var
# var_name
# var11
# 5var

# ans is - 5var
 
 
# 08. What is the maximum length of an identifier in python?
# 32
# 31
# 63
# None of the above

# ans is = none of the above


# 09. Which of the following declarations is incorrect?
# None Of the below
# _x = 2
# __x = 3
# __xyz__ = 5

# 1.0
# 2.0
# 0
# None Of the above

# ans is - 1.0


# 11. In Python, a variable must be declared before it is assigned a value:
# True
# False
 
# ans is - true 
 
# 12. Why does the name of local variables start with an underscore discouraged?
# To identify the variable
# It confuses the interpreter
# It indicates a private variable of a class
# None of these
 
# ans is - none of the above

# 13. Which of the following will run without errors?
